# General Purpose Perception Module

*Perception is the process of taking raw sensory data, and mapping it to mental models. Humans are experts at perception: They are constantly awash in raw data, and are able to quickly associate this incoming deluge with abstractions such as cars, people, events, and all manner of useful, daily concepts. Robots, as of the writing of this paper, are somewhat limited in their ability to perceive. Machine learning and pattern matching technique have provided many tools to facilitate machine perception, but they are typically too specialized for general use, and must be specially configured for each unique application. In addition, the nature of the inputs for these techniques are typically not similar to those of the human sensorium. This paper will outline the design and prototype of a general purpose perception module that can perform sensory association similar to that of a human. By incorporating this module, roboticists can interact with their robots using high-level, human concepts, including natural language. This capability has the potential to may accelerate the development of useful robotic applications.*

##Introduction

Machine learning has lately become a very popular and exciting field, with advances being published in an open and active community quite frequently. In particular, **deep learning** has initiated a resurgence in the field, with exciting results being shared in image captioning, speech recognition, and other classification tasks.
